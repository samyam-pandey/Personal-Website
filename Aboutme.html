        <h1>About me: </h1>


    <p> My name is Samyam Pandey.
        I am a junior pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science from Texas A&M University with a minor in Math. 
        Iam experienced in Python, C++, and many other coding/ machine learning applications.
        I was born in Nepal but was raised in Fort Worth, Texas for most of my life. 
        I am seeking to have a growth oriented experience where I can contribute my knowledge and skills, and enhance my experience through continuous learning and teamwork.
        I am actively seeking internship opportunities in Software Development, Cyber Security, Artificial Intelligence, and related fields.

    <h2>Hobbies: </h2>
    <p1> Some of my hoobies are playing soccer and fashion. 
        In my spare time I usually spend it either thrifting in person or online thrifting through various websites/apps such as instagram, grailed. 
        If I am not thrifting then I am in the soccer field playing soccer. 
        I am an avid hiker. 
        I have been on multiple cool hikes such as hiking in Yosemite, Taos in New Mexico, and many others. 
        My favorite hike has to be in Nepal hiking to Fishtail mountain and Mount Everest base camp. 
        I am also interested in music even though I have no musical talents in me.
        My favorite type of music is rap music but I am also open to all other genres.
        I also like traveling. 
        Some of the places in the United States I have been to are California, Florida, New York, Washington, Oregon, New Mexico, Ohio, Massachusetts, and Pennslyvnia. 
        Some countries outside of the United States are Nepal, India, Mexico, Singapore, and Canada. My favorite place to visit was Nepal. 
        Since I was born there it already has a special place in my heart. 
        Also Nepal has the nicest people I have met in my life. 
        In addition to all that Nepals scenery is amazing. 
        And the cherry on top is that the food is to die for.
